> When baking responsiveness into inline CSS remember how the cascade works!
  - Anything w/ a class name attached w/ declarations in the style tag will be superceded by any 
  declarations made at the inline level. [try to reserve the style tag for media query styling ONLY when possible]

> inline CSS is the best way to "bulletproof" your HTML EMAIL!

> All styles whether dont via attributes or an inline css declaration are to be applied to either
<td> or <table> elements - (trial and error works here)

  - A mix of old and new techniques should be employed to properly style HTML email.
    - Some aspects of styling in HTML email require some deprecated attributes to be used as CSS is simply unable to handle the job.

    - use of the attributes alongside inline CSS declarations will do the trick.

> *** THE TRICK TO GETTING TABLES TO SIT SIDE-BY-SIDE (Columns) is to set the css display property to inline-block!
    - Set a width (think fluid hybrid here - set a fluid width such as width with a percentage value along with a max-width with a fixed pixel value. Some classes may need to be added to achieve desired results!)
